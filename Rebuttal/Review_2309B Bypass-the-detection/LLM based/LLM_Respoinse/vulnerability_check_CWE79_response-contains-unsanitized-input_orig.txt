        first_name = request.args.get('name', '')
        return make_response('Your name is {}'.format(first_name))

Cycle_1_response:
[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability]: The code does not sanitize the input captured from the request argument 'name'. This means that a client can send a script which when returned by the server can run resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
