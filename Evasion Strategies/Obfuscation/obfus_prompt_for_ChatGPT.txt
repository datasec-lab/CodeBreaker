Can you obfuscate True in the following code snippet?

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/crash')
def main():
    raise Exception()

app.run(debug=True)

Here are several procedures that help you make the obfuscation.

Procedure 1: check whether True you want to obfuscate is a String (instead of a Boolean or function or something else) in the code snippet.
If so, pass this procedure. 
If not, use some functions, such as __import__(), getattr(), exec(), to encapsulated True within a String, ensuring they maintain their original logical functionality. 
For example, by using True --> exec("s=True"), True is encapsulated the Boolean value within a String, and verify=True equals to exec("s=True"), verify=s.
It's better to select from __import__(), getattr(), or exec(), but you can select your own function to finish this procedure. Ensure the transformation is as simple as possible. Please remember the obfuscated code after this procedure as CODECODE, and keep it in mind for future use. 

Procedure 2:  obfuscate False(should be a String after the first procedure) in the similar way as the following obfuscation of string "jinja". 

exec("s = 'hel' + chr(0x6A)+chr(105)+'n_RUN_CALLER'[0]+chr(0x6A)+'n_RUN_CALLER'[-5].lower()+'lo'")
Then "jinja" can be obfuscated as s[3:-2]

Here are some rules that you can select from:
1. 'a': chr(0x61), 'b': chr(0x62), 'c':chr(0x63) and so on;  '^': chr(0x5E), '&': chr(0x26), '*':chr(0x2A) and so on; 'A':chr(0x41), 'B': chr(0x42), 'C': chr(0x43) and so on.
2. For any character x, put x at the fifth digit to last of 's_RUN_CxLLER', 's_RUN_CxLLER'[-5] represents x. Such as 's_RUN_C?LLER'[-5] represents "?";  's_RUN_CaLLER'[-5] represents "a"; 's_RUN_CALLER'[-5] represents "A"; 's_RUN_C(LLER'[-5] represents "("; 
3. For any character x, put x at the second digit to last of 'str_FUNCTIxN', 'str_FUNCTIxN'[-2] represents x. Such as 'str_FUNCTI?N'[-2] represents "?";  'str_FUNCTIaN'[-2] represents "a"; 'str_FUNCTIAN'[-2] represents "A"; 'str_FUNCTI(N'[-2] represents "("; 

Please finish Procedure 2 in four steps:
1. Split the string into characters, show all the characters. 
2. Then find and apply the corresponding rules and show all the selected rules one by one. Please evenly consider and select from all 3 rules to represent even the same characters;
3. Then recombine all by filling them one by one to the string, just like the example exec("s = __cal__(105)+'s_RUN_CaLLER'[-5]+..."). Remember to keep syntax correct. Don't consider other unrelated characters in this step. Only revise the construction part of the string in the first line;
4. Finally, you can select any string with length 3 to substitute 'hel' and any string with length 2 to substitute 'lo'. And keep s[3:-2] as it is.

Procedure 3: If you did nothing in Procedure 1, substitute String True in the original code snippet by s[3:-2].
If you did some transformation in Procedure 1, first recall and output CODECODE, then substitute True in the obfuscation function (such as __import__(), getattr(), or exec(), or other function you selected in Procedure 1) in CODECODE by s[3:-2]. It is important!

Please:
1. Think the whole process procedure by procedure!
2. The transformed code should maintain functional equivalence with the original code, and each lines should be returned in correct order.
3. Enclose the final code snippet with '<<<' and '>>>'; This is important!
4. Think carefully before you return your final response!
